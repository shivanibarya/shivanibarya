                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds
of works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  (Sections 1 through 17 continue exactly as in the official GPL v3.)

  1. Source Code.
  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
  for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
  form of a work.

  2. Basic Permissions.
  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
  copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
  conditions are met.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
  measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
  11 of the WIPO copyright treaty.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
  receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
  appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
  produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
  terms of section 4.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
  of sections 4 and 5.

  7. Additional Terms.
  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
  License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.

  8. Termination.
  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
  provided under this License.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
  run a copy of the Program.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
  receives a license from the original licensors.

  11. Patents.
  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
  patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
  If conditions are imposed on you that contradict the conditions of
  this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
  permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
  under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
  of the GNU General Public License from time to time.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
  APPLICABLE LAW.

  16. Limitation of Liability.
  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW WILL ANY COPYRIGHT
  HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF THE PROGRAM.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
  above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
  reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
  an absolute waiver of all civil liability.
